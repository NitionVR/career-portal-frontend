### New Features Analysis: Employer Dashboard Enhancements

This analysis outlines the new features introduced in the experimental components, focusing on their functionality, UI/UX, and integration points within the existing eTalente application.

**1. Employer Applicant Management Module**
*   **Files:** `applicant-management.component.ts/html/css`, `applicant-management.service.ts`, `analytics-dashboard.component.ts/html`, `dialogs/bulk-action-dialog.component.ts/html`, `dialogs/collaboration-dialog.component.ts/html`, `dialogs/filter-dialog.component.ts/html`
*   **Core Feature:** A centralized and comprehensive dashboard for employers to efficiently manage their job applicants. This module significantly enhances the employer's ability to track, evaluate, and interact with candidates.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   **Applicant Listing:** Displays a detailed table of applicants, including candidate name, AI match score, key skills, experience, location, application date, and current status.
    *   **Search & Filter:** Provides robust search capabilities (by name, skills, job title) and advanced filtering options (by application status, specific skills, experience level, education, location, and AI match score) via a dedicated dialog.
    *   **Sorting:** Supports sorting applicants by various criteria.
    *   **Bulk Actions:** Enables employers to select multiple applicants and perform actions such as updating their status, adding tags, or exporting their data.
    *   **Individual Actions:** Provides options for viewing details, collaborating, contacting, and scheduling interviews for individual applicants.
    *   **Analytics Dashboard (`analytics-dashboard.component`):** Integrated within the applicant management view, this dashboard offers data-driven insights:
        *   **Summary Metrics:** Displays key figures like total applications, new applications, candidates in the interview stage, and average time to fill a position.
        *   **Pipeline Metrics:** Visualizes application status distribution (New, Reviewing, Interview, Offer, Hired, Rejected) and application sources (LinkedIn, Indeed, Website, Referral).
        *   **Demographics:** Provides insights into applicant demographics, such as gender distribution and a placeholder for geographic location.
    *   **Collaboration Dialog (`collaboration-dialog.component`):** A modal interface for team members to add notes, feedback, and share information about a specific candidate. It also displays previous notes.
    *   **Filter Dialog:** A modal (`filter-dialog.component`) for advanced filtering options.
    *   **Service Layer (`applicant-management.service.ts`):** Introduces a dedicated service to manage applicant data, including mock implementations for fetching, filtering, and updating applicants, as well as analytics data. This promotes a clean architecture and prepares for backend integration.
*   **UI/UX:** Leverages Angular Material components extensively (tables, dialogs, form fields, chips, icons, tabs, etc.) for a rich and interactive user interface. The `glassmorphism` style is applied to cards and panels, maintaining the application's aesthetic.
*   **Integration:** A new route `/employer/applicants` is added in `app.routes.ts`, and a corresponding link is included in the `EmployerSidebarComponent`.

**2. Employer Notifications Page**
*   **Files:** `employer-notifications-page.component.ts/html`
*   **Core Feature:** A dedicated section for employers to view and manage all their notifications.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   **Notification Listing:** Displays a paginated list of notifications with their title, content, and timestamp.
    *   **Mark as Read:** Users can mark individual notifications as read or mark all unread notifications as read.
    *   **Unread Count:** The `EmployerSidebarComponent` now dynamically displays the number of unread notifications, which refreshes periodically and upon route changes, providing real-time updates.
*   **Integration:** A new route `/employer/notifications` is added in `app.routes.ts`, and a navigation link with an unread count badge is added to the employer sidebar.

**3. Employer Audit Log Page**
*   **Files:** `employer-audit-log-page.component.ts/html`
*   **Core Feature:** Provides employers with a transparent view of the state changes for their job posts.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   **Job Post Selection:** Allows employers to select a specific job post from a dropdown list.
    *   **State History Display:** Presents a table showing the audit trail for the selected job post, detailing when a change occurred (`changedAt`), who made the change (`changedByEmail`), the status transition (from `fromStatus` to `toStatus`), and any associated `reason`.
    *   **Pagination:** Includes pagination for browsing through the list of job posts.
*   **Integration:** A new route `/employer/audit-log` is added in `app.routes.ts`, and a navigation link is added to the employer sidebar.

**4. Organization Members Management**
*   **Files:** `organization-members.component.ts/html/scss/css`, `invite-recruiter-dialog.component.ts/html`
*   **Core Feature:** Enhances the company profile section with capabilities to manage team members and invitations within the organization.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   **Member Listing:** Displays a table of active organization members, showing their name, email, role, status, and joined date.
    *   **Pending Invitations:** Lists all pending invitations to join the organization, with options to resend or revoke them.
    *   **Invite Recruiters:** A modal dialog allows employers to invite new recruiters by entering their email addresses and an optional personal message.
    *   **Role Management:** Functionality to update the roles of existing members (e.g., promote to Hiring Manager, assign as Recruiter).
    *   **Member Removal:** Allows removing members from the organization.
    *   **Filtering/Searching:** Provides options to filter members by role and search by name or email.
*   **UI/UX:** Utilizes Angular Material components for tables, dialogs, and form elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel. Custom SCSS provides specific styling for metric cards and member avatars.
*   **Integration:** This module is integrated as a new tab ("Organization Members") within the existing `CompanyProfileComponent`.

**5. General Enhancements & Refinements**
*   **`app.routes.ts`:** Updated to include all the new employer-specific routes, ensuring proper navigation.
*   **`app.config.ts`:** The order of `APP_INITIALIZER` providers has been adjusted to ensure `authInitializerProvider` runs before `loadConfig`, which is a crucial initialization sequence.
*   **`employer-sidebar.component.ts/html`:** The employer sidebar has been updated with new navigation links for "Applicants", "Notifications", and "Audit Log". It also now displays a dynamic unread notification count, enhancing user awareness.
*   **`job-post-form.component.ts`:** Minor code cleanup in the `onSubmit` method, specifically around how `jobType` and `remote` fields are mapped.
*   **`employer-application-details/employer-application-details.component.html` & `homepage.component.html`:** Minor UI adjustments, likely related to layout or component integration.
*   **`status-dropdown.component.ts`:** A minor change in a console log message.

**Overall Impression:**

These experimental components represent a significant expansion of the employer-facing features, moving towards a more complete talent management platform. The additions focus on providing employers with robust tools for applicant tracking, team collaboration, organizational oversight, and data analytics. The consistent use of Angular Material and the existing design system ensures that these new features will integrate seamlessly into the application's UI/UX. The use of mock data in the services indicates a well-structured approach to frontend development, allowing for parallel work with backend teams.
