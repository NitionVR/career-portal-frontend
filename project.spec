  ## Description
  
  The current registration flow is too generic. We need to implement a more  sophisticated, multi-step registration process that distinguishes between CANDIDATE and HIRING_MANAGER roles from the beginning, capturing different information for each and using a magic link for email verification.

           (CANDIDATE or HIRING_MANAGER).

           send it as part of a magic link to the user's email.
  
  * [x]  Create role-specific DTOs: CandidateRegistrationDto and 
  
           HiringManagerRegistrationDto.
  
  * [x] Create role-specific completion endpoints: /api/auth/register/candidate 
  
           and /api/auth/register/hiring-manager.
  
  * [x] These endpoints should validate the registration token and create a new 
  
           User with the appropriate role and role-specific data.
  
  * [x] The User entity must be updated to include all new fields (e.g., 
  
           firstName, companyName, username, etc.).
  
  * [x] Upon successful completion, the user should be considered verified and 
  
           logged in (i.e., receive a session JWT).
  
  * [x]  A /api/auth/validate-registration-token endpoint should be created for 
  
           the frontend to verify a token before rendering a form.
  
  * [x] Add comprehensive integration tests for the entire flow.
