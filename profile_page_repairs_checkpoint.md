# Profile Page Repairs Checkpoint

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes

### 1. Form Control Mismatch

*   **Issue:** The `FormGroup` in `profile-create.ts` was missing several controls (`username`, `contactNumber`, etc.) that were being used in the HTML template, causing runtime errors.
*   **Status:** âœ… **Done**
*   **Details:** The `initForm` method was updated to include all required controls for both `CANDIDATE` and `HIRING_MANAGER` roles, including validators for `minLength` and phone number patterns.

### 2. Missing Loading State Display

*   **Status:** âœ… **Done**
*   **Details:** Added an `*ngIf="isLoading"` block to the template to show a loading spinner. The main form is now wrapped in `*ngIf="!isLoading"` to prevent it from displaying prematurely.

*   **Status:** âœ… **Done**
*   **Details:** Added an `isSubmitting` boolean flag. The submit button is now disabled and shows a loading indicator when `isSubmitting` is true. The flag is reset if an API error occurs.

## Phase 3: Validation & UX Improvements

### 5. Field-Level Error Messages
