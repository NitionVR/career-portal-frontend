# Profile Page Repairs Checkpoint

This document tracks the incremental fixes being applied to the Profile Create page, based on the analysis from `profile_page_repair_suggestions.log`.

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes

### 1. Form Control Mismatch

*   **Issue:** The `FormGroup` in `profile-create.ts` was missing several controls (`username`, `contactNumber`, etc.) that were being used in the HTML template, causing runtime errors.
*   **Status:** ✅ **Done**
*   **Details:** The `initForm` method was updated to include all required controls for both `CANDIDATE` and `HIRING_MANAGER` roles, including validators for `minLength` and phone number patterns.

### 2. Missing Loading State Display

*   **Status:** ✅ **Done**
*   **Details:** Added an `*ngIf="isLoading"` block to the template to show a loading spinner. The main form is now wrapped in `*ngIf="!isLoading"` to prevent it from displaying prematurely.

*   **Status:** ✅ **Done**
*   **Details:** Added an `isSubmitting` boolean flag. The submit button is now disabled and shows a loading indicator when `isSubmitting` is true. The flag is reset if an API error occurs.

## Phase 2: Design & Consistency Fixes

### 4. CSS Variables Inconsistency

*   **Status:** ✅ **Done**
*   **Details:** Replaced all hardcoded color values in `custom-select.component.css` with the appropriate `hsl(var(--...))` variables from the design system.

## Phase 3: Validation & UX Improvements

### 5. Field-Level Error Messages

*   **Issue:** The component lacks helper methods and template logic to display specific validation errors next to each invalid field.
*   **Status:** ✅ **Done**
*   **Details:** Added `hasError` and `getErrorMessage` helpers to the component. The template now uses these methods to display specific error messages under each field and applies a `border-destructive` class to invalid inputs. The `onSubmit` method was also updated to mark all fields as touched to trigger validation display.
