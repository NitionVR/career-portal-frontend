# API Refactor Requirement: Flatten CandidateProfileDto

**Objective:** To simplify the API and improve developer experience by refactoring the `CandidateProfileDto` to be a flat structure that directly represents the JSON Resume schema.

---

### **Problem Analysis**

The current `ApplicationDetailsDto` returns a `candidateProfile` object with a confusing and deeply nested structure. Key data points exist at multiple levels, and the full resume data is buried inside a `profile` property.

**Current (Confusing) Structure:**
```json
{
  "candidateProfile": {
    "id": "...",
    "firstName": "AMOS", // Redundant
    "lastName": "MAGANYANE", // Redundant
    "summary": null, // Top-level summary is null
    "profile": { // Entire resume is nested here
      "basics": {
        "name": "AMOS MAGANYANE",
        "summary": "I am the best software engineer..." // The real summary
      },
      "work": [],
      "skills": []
      // ...etc
    }
  }
}
```

This structure causes several problems:
1.  **Confusion:** It's unclear which property to use (e.g., `firstName` vs. `profile.basics.name`).
2.  **Complexity:** The frontend has to write complex, error-prone logic to navigate the nested objects (`application.candidateProfile?.profile?.work`).
3.  **Inconsistency:** It doesn't cleanly map to the JSON Resume standard.

### **Required Change**

**Endpoint to Modify:** `GET /api/applications/{id}`

**Action:** The `CandidateProfileDto` returned by this endpoint must be flattened. It should **be** the JSON Resume object, not contain it.

**The `profile` property should be removed, and all its contents should be moved up to the top level of the `CandidateProfileDto`.**

**New, Correct Structure:**
```json
{
  "candidateProfile": {
    "id": "...", // Keep the user ID
    "basics": {      // <-- Moved to top level
      "name": "AMOS MAGANYANE",
      "email": "...",
      "summary": "I am the best software engineer..."
    },
    "work": [],        // <-- Moved to top level
    "skills": [],      // <-- Moved to top level
    "education": []    // <-- Moved to top level
    // etc.
  }
}
```

### **Benefits of this Change**

*   **Simplicity:** The API becomes much easier to understand and use.
*   **Consistency:** It aligns perfectly with the JSON Resume standard that the frontend form is based on.
*   **Robustness:** It eliminates bugs on the frontend caused by developers having to guess which nested property to access.

This is a high-priority refactoring that will significantly improve the stability and maintainability of the application.
